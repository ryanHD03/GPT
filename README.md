## GPT Calculator

This project implements a transformer-based model using PyTorch to generate and solve basic arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.8+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanHD03/GPT.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
  - To train the model, run the 'main.py' script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
  - The training script will generate random arithmetic problems (10 by default), encode them, and feed them to the model. The model is trained to predict the result of the arithmetic operation.
